Release Notes

V1.3 released on 12th of Apr 2013
Bug fix:
- Collection creation in combination with the clean up option caused an error. This is
fixed.
- The ignore keywords checkbox was not recognized. This is fixed.

Improvements:
- Integrates now exiftool to get more details about the photos. Sequential shootings
tend to produce duplicates because of the time resolution based on seconds. Now 
Teekesselchen can read data, which is not provided by Lightroom itself, e.g. the sub-second
or the sequence number.

V1.2 released on 3rd of Mar 2013
Bug fix:
- The option mark duplicates as rejected caused an error in Lighroom versions < 4.x

V1.1 released on 19th of Feb 2013
Bug fixes:
- Ignore keywords caused an execution error. This is fixed.
- The help link on the About tab referenced a wrong page. This is fixed.
- The summary page used the term smart folder. This has been changed to the right term
smart collection.

Improvements:
- Prior clean up of the duplicate smart collection. If activated this collection
shows duplicates from the last run only.
